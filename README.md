# agente-ia-Menor-caminho-entre-duas-cidades

- The goal of the agent "FindRoute" is to find the optimal route between two cities in a pre-established map, with those cities being represented by uppercase letters strings.

- The 'routes' are represented in the map, by a dict acessed with the current city name and the target city's name, returning an int indicative of how much time it took.
